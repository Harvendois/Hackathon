# Hackathon

Hello, Jackie and Yejun, here are some basic steps in using the Git together!

1. Clone the repository to your working environment (e.g. VSC)
2. Make your own branch (we will help you)

From here on, please repeat whenever you start working again (쉬었다가 다시할때):

3. Pull from main branch
4. If you are done working on your part, pull request.
